1. What is a Good Seminar on topic X
Questions that must get answered:

- What is X?
- Why is X important? What is its place in the world at large/world of Computer Science?
- What are the main intellectual questions?
- What are the answers/approaches?
- Some details regarding the important approaches. Your favourite approaches.
- What are the unsolved problem?

2. The Right Attitude - I
You: The expert, the teacher
Audience: (including the examiners) are learners.

Semimar Presentation differs Oral examination
Seminar Presentation is equivalent to Teaching

Evaluation of Report differs Evaluation of Exam paper.
Evaluation of Report is equivalent to Book review.

Know your subject as an expert.
- Collect enough information about the topic.
- Digest it well.
- Present it well.

Learn to be independent!

3. The Right Attitude - II
You: Storyteller
Rest of us: Your audience. We expect to:
- Learn something new.
- Learn something that arouses our interest.
- Hear something clever/suprising/intriguing.
- Learn something useful, e.g., a new tool.

4. Formulate your topic properly
As you read more papers you should
- Refine/Broaden your topic.
- Go deeper with what you like.
(Consult your advisor!)

Only goal: Should have enough material for telling a good story.
Good Story: Enough depth, enough breadth.

Q: What is the most difficult problem in all this?
A: The most difficult problem is X, and here is why it is hard/deep/challenging.
Q: Why have you looked at just one approach?
A: Because it is supposed to be the most promising one, and it it very good/clever 
enough in itself.


5. Collecting information

Starting points:
- Web search.
- Recent research paper/book on the topic. (Ask your advisor!). Follow the bibliographic
references mentioned there.

Acceptable Sources of information:
- Research Papers
- Handbooks/Surveys/Books
- Technical reports
- Websites
- Manuals

How many papers/books to read?
At least 2-3 big papers (Ask advisors)
Enough for you to tell a story.

How to read papers?
Read over several passes: If you dont understand something in the first reading,
go past it and finish the rest of the paper. It may become obvious in the second reading.

Start Early!
Read critically: Even published papers have mistakes, half-truths. Understand which
are opinions and which are undoubtable truths.
Identify the real issues.
Work out examples.
Think of alternative formulations.
Understand the terminology.

Additional Reading
Topics related to yours: Need to have some familiarity.
General Area: Might need to do additional reading/brushing up.

BUT you must be very familiar with the basics even if the topic is advanced.

6. Report + Presentation
- Organize by issue, not by papers you read.
- Use your own words.
- Be prepared to defend everthing you write.

Value Addition: Why should the reader read your paper and not the original papers?
- Because you give a single integrated report.
- Because you compare the different papers.
- Because you explain the difficult parts of the papers.
- Because you give worked out examples.
- Because you wrote (short) programs which test the ideas whose results you present.
- Any other

Weekly Meeting:
- Saying your thoughts aloud clarifies them.
- Guide may steer you away from blind alleys.
- Might himself have read new papers related to your topic.
- Indicates your sincerity.

You must take the initiative in arranging the meeting.
Good Luck.
