How to give talks (Seminar Presentation, and others!)

Dont Worry if you are Nervous
Natural in the beginning.
Natural even later.

Public speaking is not hard if you prepare well:
Mastery over material.
Carefully select material to present.
Learn the art of making transparencies.
Rehearse many times. With friends. With advisor.

Public speaking skills are very valuable.
Improve your personality, gain confidence.
"Worth putting in a lot of effort."

1. Seminar Talk

Audience for the talk: Your classmates, colleagues, etc.
Talk should induce audience to read report.
20 minute time limit. Talk is a subset of Report.
Talk must be self contained. Talk audience may not read report.
Audience expectation:
- Understand topic. Understand basic problem.
- Understand solution approaches.
- Get surprised, intrigued.
- Hear something clever.

2. Structure of Talk

Introduction: Real world relevance, Clear statement of problem
Outline
Core of the talk:
- Topic 1, Topic 2, Topic 3, ...
Concluding remarks. Summary. Open problems.

Possible Structure of Each Topic
Introduction - Core - Concluding Remarks/Summary

How to Introduce

"Light hearted opening" Establish real-world connection/motivation for the topic.
- Interesting stories
- Philosophical remark
- Example of Problem (pictorial if possible)
- Puzzle

Problem statement:
- Description of input and output.
- What is to be optimized (if anything).
- Overview of approaches. Obvious approaches, what is wrong with them.
- Statement of main results.
- Why is the problem hard.

NOTE: NO MORE THAN 5 MINUTES!

"CORE" of the talk
"2-3 topics in-depth" better than 10 topics sketchily
Choose topics that are:
- Important.
- Interesting to describe. Contain clever tricks.
- Visually appealing.
- Describable within the given time limit.

OMIT unimportant details: "I will only explain the first step of this proof, the other steps are routine and are described in the report".
"I will only describe the second step of the algorithm ..."

Simplify theorems/proofs: "I will prove a simpler version in the talk;
the report contains a more general version, whose proof is much more complicated."
"I will describe an O(NlogN) algorithm in the talk; 
but it is possible to improve to O(N) using standard techniques- this is described in the report."

Trade-off: Bite what you can chew.

Statements of theorems: May be simplified, but Precision is still necessary.
Definitions: Simplify if possible, but DO NOT OMIT! Clarify with examples.
Examples: Most essential! After definitions, after theorems, after problem statements.
Proof By examples: Acceptable if examples are well chosen. (NOT acceptable in Report)
Pictures: Worth a thousand words. Maybe simple sketches.

Transparency: The Basic Building Block
1 transparency = 1 (atomic) idea/topic
Title of the transparency: Important. Should suggest what the transparency contains.
Rest: Should contain points, not full sentences. Should be Readable in a glance.
Final line: May summarize the transparency.

Mechanics of Transparencies
- Point at the screen. Not at your computer.
- Standback and Look at the screen. Ensure screen visible.
- Use overlays: transparency 1 contains problem, overlay contains solution.

How to Add Emphasis
- Explicitly write/say "XYZ is very important".
- Font change. Highlight using colours.
- Put boxes around it.
- Make "XYZ" be the title of a transparency.
- PAUSE after describing "XYZ".

Important Transparencies
- Talk title: Include your name and your suppervisor's name. Your name should not
be in smaller font than your suppervisor's.
- Problem Statement/Main Issues: Transparency(ies) stating the main questions to
be discussed in the talk. Title may be different.
- Outline: Very sessential. Should come after introduction and statement of problem.
- Conclusions: What listener should remember from your talk. Include open problems.
Title(s) may be different.

3. Answering Questions
- Clarification Questions: "I didnot follow your definition, what if ..."
Should be answered immediately.
- Argumentative/Evaluative Questions: "What is your openion of xyz method?".
Better to defer to the end. Politely say so.

- Should expect questions on Report and Talk.
- Anticipate possible questions. Prepare few transparencies in advance.
- Honestly is the best policy. "I donot know xyz, but shall I explain xyz' which is related?"
- Not enough to say "Author PQR says so". Explain why and whether you believe PQR.

4. Describing Algorithms and Proofs
Describe overall idea and structure: Try to convey intuition.
Describe algorithms at a high level: Describe pictorially if possible.
Consider top down style.
Explain data structures: Mention invariants. Draw BEFORE and AFTER pictures.
(*) LaTex has packages for writing algorithms Manages indentation, highlights keyworks.

Credit Where Credit is Due
Very clearly mention the source of the ideas you discuss.
If some idea is your own, mention that very explicitly.
If you constructed an example, say "I will now show an example that I constructed to
explain the theorem".
If you found a shorter proof, mention that.

5. Concluding Remarks
- Practice makes perfect.
- Oratory (the art or practice of formal speaking in public.) is an art.
Rules are not absolute.
- Break rules if you must, but be prepared to say why.
- Hear good speakers. Copy good speakers.
