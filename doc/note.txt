SUBJECT: Inquiry about the Postdoctoral position in XXX Deep Learning with a focus on Vision-Language Models


Dear Prof. Ekta Vats,
My name is Van-Hao Le, a final-year Ph.D. candidate in the LIFAT group at the University of Tours, France, under the supervision of Prof. Huber Cardot and Prof. Mathieu Delalandre. 
Previously, I served as a lecturer at Hong Duc University, Vietnam.

I am about to finish my Ph.D. study (no later than the new school year in 09/2024). 
My research focuses on ‘evaluating performance on 2D CNN-based features for the problem of partial video copy detection’. 
Currently, I am looking for postdoc opportunities relevant to my skills and interests. 

I have reviewed the requirements outlined in the job posting (https://www.jobb.uu.se/details/?positionId=716388) and noted that you seek candidates with a doctoral degree. 
However, I would appreciate clarification on whether candidates in their final year of PhD studies are eligible to apply for the position. 
My research interests and academic background fit quite well with the objectives of your team, and I am confident in my ability to make valuable contributions to your ongoing projects.

I have attached my CV, which provides further details about my academic background, research experience, and publications. 
I would be grateful for the opportunity to discuss how my skills and research interests align with the requirements of the postdoctoral position.

Thank you for considering my inquiry. I look forward to your response and the possibility of this postdoctoral position.

Warm regards,
Van-Hao Le
